# ToDew

Project created while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s JavaScript [course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript).

## Notes

- While doing this project, I learned a lot about why libraries/frameworks like React and Vue exist. It's a LOT of work to manage state and update the DOM manually. I'm glad I learned how to do it, and now have a greater appreciation for the tools that make it easier.
